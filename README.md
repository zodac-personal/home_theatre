# Backups

## Creating Backups

### Scheduled Backups

The following containers have backup systems which are configured to take weekly backups.
You can either retrieve the latest automated backup, or can export a fresh one.

For the following containers, a new backup can be generated by going to **System**> **Backup**> **Backup Now**.

- `bazarr`
- `lidarr`
- `prowlarr`
- `radarr`
- `sonarr`

For the `airsonic` container, a new backup can be generated by going to **Settings**> **Database**> **Export Database**.

### Built-In Backups

The following containers have no scheduled backup, but there is an option in the UI to export one:

- `calibre`
- `tandoor`

For the `calibre` container, the backup can be generated by going to the toolbar and selecting **\[LIBRARY_NAME\]**> **Export/import all calibre data
**> **Export all your calibre data**> **Select all libraries**.

For the `tandoor` container, the backup can be generated by clicking on the toolbox icon in the toolbar, selecting **Export**, selecting the **All
recipes** option, then pressing the **Export** button.

### Manual Backups

The following containers have no built-in backup systems, and must have their content archived manually.

- `calibre-web-1`
- `calibre-web-2`
- `homebox`

For the `calibre-web` containers, a new backup can be generated by connecting to the container and manually archiving the `/config` directory, using
the commands:

```
docker exec -it calibre-web-1 bash
root@calibre-web-1:/# tar -czf config.tar.gz /config/

docker exec -it calibre-web-2 bash
root@calibre-web-2:/# tar -czf config.tar.gz /config/
```

For the `homebox` container, there is an import/export feature, but we need to manually backup any uploaded screenshots/PDFs/attachments. This can be
done using the commands:

```
docker exec -it homebox bash
root@homebox:/# tar -czf data.tar.gz /data/
```

### No Backups

The following containers have no need for backups, or backups are not used:

- `doplarr`
- `flaresolverr`
- `qbittorrent`
- `unpackerr`

## Retrieving Backups

Once a backup has been created on the container, it should be copied to the host system. This can be done by copying the file from the container.
If you are unsure of where the file is saved, you can connect to the container and search the file system by using the command:

```
docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID] bash
```

Once you know the filepath of the backup file, you can copy it to the host by executing this command from the host itself:

```
docker cp [CONTAINER_ID]:/path/to/backup/file.tar.gz ./host/path/to/backup/file.tar.gz
```
